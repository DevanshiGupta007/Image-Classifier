# Image-Classifier 

  This the Image Classifier project which is a part of Object Detection using CNN(Convulational Neural Network).
  
  #PLATFORMS USED:
  
  1.Google Collab.
  
  #Requirement :
  
  1.Images dataset to test the model.
  
  
  
  #CONTENT :
  
  1.LOADING THE DATASET(KERAS DATASET USED)
  2.PRINT THE DATATYPE.
  3.GET THE SHAPES OF THE DATA.
  4.FIRST IMAGE IN THE TRAINING DATASET(AT INDEX=0)
  5.SHOW IMAGE AS PICTURE.
  6.LABELLING THE IMAGE 
  7.CONVERTING THE LABELS INTO THE SET OF 10 NUMBERS TO INPUT INTO THE NUERAL NETWORK LATER.
  8.PRINTING THE NEW LABELS IN THE TRAINING DATASET.
  9.TESTING  THE EXAMPLES OF THE NEW LABELS.
  10.NORMALIZE THE PIXELS IN THE IMAGE BETWEEN 0 AND 1.
  11.BUILDING THE CNN.
  12.COMPILE THE MODEL.
  13.TRANING THE MODEL.
  14.GETTING THE MODEL ACCURACY .
  15.VISUALIZING THE MODEL ACCURACY .
  16.VISUALIZING THE MODEL LOSS.
  17.LOADING THE DATA 
  18.SHOWING THE UPLOADED IMAGE .
  19.RESIZING THE IMAGE .
  20.GETTING THE PROBABILITY FOR THE CLASSES IT BELONG.
  21.PRINTING THE PROBABILITIES.
  22.Saving the model.
  23.Loading the model.
